#Problem Statement :
1.	This assignment is called "FavouritePackages". In this assignment, the user will be shown a form, with a search input, a selectable radio button list, and a text area.
2.	The user does a name-based search on NPM using the Search input.
3.	The search API gets called as the user type on the input box.
- Search API: https://api.npms.io/v2/search?q=reactjs
4.	The result from the search API is shown on the list below the search input. It is a list of radio buttons.
5.	The user will select a package from the list and write down why the package is one of his favourite packages.
6.	After adding a favourite, the user should be taken to the home page, where he can see the list of added packages in a tabular format.
7.	The user should be able to delete the individual packages from this table. Confirm before deleting the package from the list.


# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
